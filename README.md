# My Portfolio

It's time to start working on this portfolio I've wanted for a while. After a web development internship and another semester of programming classes, I should be ready to build something I can be proud of.

## Style
Not too sure on the specific style yet. I want something visually striking but not overwhelming. Animations would be really nice.

I really want a sky feel. IMHHW vibe.
